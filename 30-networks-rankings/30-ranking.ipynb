    "### Elections vs. winner selection\n",
    "We define an *election procedure* as a method for generating a ranking (ordering) of a set of candidates from voter preferences. Note that an election does not just name the top candidate, but instead, ranks all of the candidates. (This slightly differs from everyday usage.) We refer to a procedure that only decides the top candidate as a *winner selection method*. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the relationship between these two problems? Clearly, one could recursively use a winner selection method   to define an election procedure. (First choose a winner, then remove the winner from the ballot and use the winner selection method to choose the runner-up, *etc*...) Conversely, the number one ranked alternative in an election procedure can be considered the winner, so every election procedure generates a winner selection method. So are these two problems---elections and winner selection---really equivalent? No, there are election procedures which cannot be derived from recursively selecting a winner.  Thus, election procedures are more general and winner selection methods should be considered a subset of election procedures. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that if there are only two candidates, then the  election and winner-selection methods are the same. In this case,  any reasonable method will select the candidate for which the *majority* of the electorate favors.  In the following discussion, we'll assume that there are three or more candidates. The interesting case arises when no single candidate receives a majority of the votes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  In the U. S., elections are generally decided by the plurality method or some variation thereof. (Presidential elections in the U.S. involve the electoral college, but I'm not going to discuss this here.) In the *plurality method*, each voter votes for a single candidate and the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner. It often occurs that the candidate does not receive a majority of the votes.  For example, George W. Bush was elected president in 2000 with 47.87% of the votes and Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992 with 43.01% of the votes. In both cases, \"third-party\" candidates (Ralph Nader and Ross Perot respectively) prevented the winner (or, possibly, the runner-up) from receiving a majority vote. Other voting methods may have resulted in alternative  outcomes in these two elections. For example, in France, Russia, and Brazil, a *runoff election* is held, in which only the top two candidates appear on the ballot. This idea can be further generalized to an election procedure called the *elimination method*, where the candidate with the smallest number of votes is removed from the ballot in each round. This method is used by the International Olympic Committee to select the host for the Olympic games. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Election methods\n",
    "We write $a,b,c,\\ldots$ to denote candidates and $i,j,k,\\ldots$ to denote voters. \n",
    "Each voter has his/her own preferences. We write \n",
    "$a \\succ_i b$\n",
    "if candidate $a$ is preferred to candidate $b$ by voter $i$. If voter $i$ has no preference over candidates $a$ and $b$, we write $a=_i b$. Finally we write \n",
    "$a \\succeq_i b$\n",
    "to indicate that candidate $b$ is not preferred to candidate $a$ by voter $i$; that is, either: $a\\succ_i b$ or $a=_i b$.  We require the voter preferences to satisfy the following relationships:\n",
    "1. For each pair of candidates, $a$ and $b$,  exactly one of the following holds: $a\\succ_i b$, $b\\succ_i a$, or $a=_i b$. \n",
    "+ For all candidates $a$, $a=_i a$. \n",
    "+ Each voter ranking should give a transitive relation: $a \\succeq_i b$ and $b \\succeq_i c$ implies that $a \\succeq_i c$ \n",
    "with $a=_i c$ if and only if $a=_i b$ and $b=_i c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "An *election method* is a method for generating a ranking of the candidates from the voter preferences that satisfy the above three properties. The relationships generated by the election procedure are  denoted by $\\succ$, $=$, and $\\succeq$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different election methods, for example, the [Borda count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) and [Copeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland%27s_method) methods. It can be shown that these methods have drastically different properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "We say that a candidate is a *Condorcet candidate* if he beats every other candidate in head-to-head competition (that is, with all other candidates removed from the ballot).  It is not difficult to show that a Condorcet candidate does not necessarily exist, but if one does, it is unique. Intuitively it would seem desirable for a winner selection method to select the Condorcet candidate, if one exists. One can show that the Copeland  method has the property but the Borda count does not. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might prompt us to write down a list of desirable properties and then see which election methods satisfy which properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "![http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system](ElectionMethodProperties.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the table is an election method and each column is a desirable property. The entries of the table indicate whether or not the election method satisfies that property. Don't worry about how we define all of these methods or all of the properties. Note that Plurality, Runoff voting, Borda count, and Copeland are among the methods compared and  that the Condorcet property is the third column in the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this table, we observe that none of the election methods satisfy all of the (desirable) properties. Of course, tomorrow someone could invent a new election method and we could then check to see which of these properties hold for that method.  This leads us to the following question: is it possible that there exists a method that  satisfies all (or possibly a chosen subset) of these properties?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrow's impossibility theorem\n",
    "In the following, we define five sensible criteria which we expect a fair and reasonable  election procedure should satisfy. Surprisingly, in 1963, Kenneth Arrow proved that there does not exist an election procedure which can satisfy all five criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "We say an election procedure is *fair* if it satisfies the following five criteria:\n",
    "1. All conceivable voter rankings are allowed. \n",
    "2. If $a \\succeq_i b$ for all voters $i$, then $a\\succeq b$ with equality if and only if $a=_i b$ for all voters $i$. We interpret this to mean that unanimous opinions are respected. \n",
    "3. If in two different elections, each voter ranks candidates $a$ and $b$ the same, then the election outcomes between $a$ and $b$ are the same in the two elections. That is, how candidates are ranked relative to each other in an election depends only on how the voters rank them relative to each other and not how they are ranked relative to other candidates. Denoting preferences in the second election by the symbol $\\supseteq$, we express this property in symbols: \n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\text{If} \\ \\forall i, \\ a\\succeq_i b \\ \\iff \\ a\\supseteq_i b, \\quad  \\text{then} \\ a\\succeq b \\iff a \\supseteq b.  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "4. If there are two elections such that $a\\succeq_i b$ implies $a \\supseteq_i b$ for all $i$, and if also $a \\succeq b$, then $a\\supseteq b$. In other words, if $a$ does at least as well as $b$ in a later ranking by the voters as he did in the present ranking, and if he beat $b$ in the present election, he'll beat $b$ in the later election. \n",
    "5.  There is no voter $i$ such that $a\\succ b$ if and only if $a\\succ_i b$. In other words, there is no dictator. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the absurdity that the presence of the third option should not influence the voters preference between the other two, we consider the following anecdote attributed to Sidney Morgenbesser. \n",
    "\n",
    "```After finishing his meal, a diner decides to order dessert from a restaurant. The waitress tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. The diner orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point the diner says: \"In that case I'll have the blueberry pie.\" ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.** No election procedure for three or more candidates is fair. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, one has to be very careful when considering the method used for an election. No method is fair and, at worse, the method can be exploited by a coalition of the voters. \n"

    "We can interpret this problem on a directed graph as follows. A vertex is assigned to each item to be ranked. We then add directed edges (arcs) to the graph between each vertex pair for which there is a pairwise comparison.  The orientation of the arcs is chosen based on the signs of the pairwise preferences. If $y_{i,j}>0$, then our convention is choose the arc orientation $(i,j)$ instead of $(j,i)$. Thus, the equation $\\phi_i - \\phi_j \\approx y_{i,j}$ is enforcing the requirement that item $i$ is preferred to item $j$. We enumerate the arcs $A = \\{k\\}_{k=1}^m$.
